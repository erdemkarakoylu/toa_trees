<h2>MLflow pipeline for hyperparameter tuning, training, and prediction using XGBoost and nested cross-validation</h2>

<u>Pipeline Functions</u>

<h3>1. Data Loading and Preparation</h3>

*Purpose*: Load your spectral data (features and target concentrations) from files or data sources.

*Tasks*:
* Handle missing values (if any) â€“ imputation or removal.
* Check data types and convert to numerical if necessary.
* Optionally, perform feature scaling or transformations (standardization, normalization, etc.).
* Split the data into training and testing sets for evaluation.
* Potentially, apply dimensionality reduction techniques if needed.

<h3>2. Nested Cross-Validation (NCV)</h3>

*Purpose*: Robustly evaluate model performance and select the best hyperparameters.

*Tasks*:

* Divide the training data into outer and inner folds.
* Outer Loop:
    * Train the model with different hyperparameter combinations on the inner folds.
    * Select the best model based on inner cross-validation performance.
    * Evaluate the selected model on the outer test fold.
Inner Loop:
    * Perform hyperparameter tuning (e.g., using grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization) on various XGBoost parameters.

<h3>3. XGBoost Model Training</h3>

*Purpose*: Train the XGBoost model with the optimal hyperparameters found in the NCV process.

*Tasks*: 
* Initialize the XGBoost regressor with the chosen hyperparameters.
* Fit the model on the entire training set.
* Optionally, calculate feature importances.

<h3>4. Model Prediction</h3>

*Purpose*: Make predictions on new, unseen spectral data.

*Tasks*:
* Load and preprocess new data in the same way as the training data.
* Apply the trained XGBoost model to predict concentrations.
* Potentially, transform the predictions back to the original scale if needed.

<h3>5. Model Evaluation</h3>

*Purpose*: Assess model performance on the test set and (optionally) new data.

*Tasks*:
* Calculate appropriate multi-output metrics (e.g., average MSE, average R-squared, multivariate explained variance).
* Visualize errors and residuals for each output.
* Generate prediction intervals (e.g., using bootstrapping) to quantify uncertainty.

<h3>6. MLflow Logging (Integrated throughout)</h3>

*Purpose*: Track experiments, record parameters, metrics, and store trained models.

*Tasks*:
* Start MLflow runs.
* Log model parameters (XGBoost parameters, PCA settings if used).
* Log evaluation metrics.
* Save the trained XGBoost model as an MLflow artifact.
